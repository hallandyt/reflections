When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	e.g., when you want to share your code publicly, or you have multiple contributors

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	you might be working on changes that aren't yet merged with the cloud
	version

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A branch is a new strand of the project. A clone is a copy of the project and its
	commit history. A fork is a clone that you use as the framework for a spinoff 
	project.
