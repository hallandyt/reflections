What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	basically turns version control on for that directory, which lets you make
	commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	staging area is an intermediate step that lets you assemble the files you
	want in the commit, but not necessarily the whole directory worth of files

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	you make sure only files relevant to the change are included in the commit 
	you're about to pull the trigger on

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	You might be working on multiple independent projects at the same time, or
	fixing a bug while also working on a new feature elsewhere

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	you can tell each commit's parent, and see if any commits are unreachable

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
