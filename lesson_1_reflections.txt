How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    eliminates irrelevant info and focuses on differences 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    debugging, tracking your learning

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   you know better than Google Docs which points in time are relevant milestones

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    coding has the peculiar feature of having many interrelated files all being
    changed at overlapping times

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows whole change history at all relevant commits; git diff lets
    you compare differences between two of those commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can rest easy knowing you have a breadcrumb trail to get back to 
    the version that worked earlier

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version control of apps and trying new code without fear of breaking
    everything
